            <h2>Welcome to We Love Food</h2>
            <p>Besides the fact that we need it to survive, why do we love food so much? The taste, the smell, the warm
            feeling it gives us as it fills us up? Like addictive drugs, highly palatable foods trigger feel-good brain chemicals
            such as dopamine. Once people experience pleasure associated with increased dopamine transmission in the 
            brain's reward pathway from eating certain foods, they quickly feel the need to eat it again. Everything
            is good - just in moderation. 
            </p>

             <p>According to studies, the top ten most addictive foods are pizza, chocolate, chips, cookies, ice cream, french
            fries, hamburgers, sodas, cake, and cheese. As if they had to tell us. But personally, my overall favorite is any 
            type of seafood. Although we love these foods, remember that everything in modesty is better, so if you feel like you 
            may be addicted or find yourself constantly craving unhealthy foods, just try to take these steps to cut back; Get more 
            sleep, or regulate your sleep schedule, make sure you're drinking plenty of water to stay hydrated, try lowering stress 
            and anxiety levels, try chewing gum, or portion control your meals!
