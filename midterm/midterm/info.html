        <h1>More Information on Everyday Health!</h1>
    <p>Here are a few tips on how to improve your health day-to-day:
        <ol>
            <li>~ Begin your day doing at least 1 to 2 productive things every morning when you wake up. (Make the bed,
                clean, etc.)
            <li>~ Drink water every single day (preferably 6 bottles.)
            <li>~ Get outside and enjoy the outdoors/sun, even if only for a few minutes.
            <li>~ Practice positive thinking, and make a habit out of reducing negativeness including 
                negative thoughts.
            <li>~ Do as many kind things as you can for people throughout the day. This will also make 
                their day better. :)
            <li>~ Don't forget to stop and breathe every now and then. Enjoy the little things in life.</li>
            </ol>
