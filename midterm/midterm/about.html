        <h1>What You Should Know About Fitness!</h1>
        <p>Why is fitness so important? Why can't we just eat pizza and talk to our dogs all day? That's a good question!
            Physical Fitness has been around since the beginning of time- but back then it probably wasn't thought 
            of as "fitness," but more so of just typical everyday life. This is because, before vehicles were invented humans had 
            to walk everywhere, but eventually invented the wagon and carriage. Fitness actually didn't become popular until the 70's when jogging
            and jazzercise were a thing. Since then, exercising has just gone up on the popular chart! A lot of people now actually consider it "a way of life," and 
            not so much as a job that you have to work at. 
        </p>

        <p>Exercising is important for various reasons:
            <ol>
            <li> It improves your quality of sleep, which we all know is important.
            <li> It helps improve your memory and brain function, and improves overall heart health.
            <li> It increases your levels of serotonin(the happy chemical) in your brain, and reduces feelings of
                anxiety and depression.
            <li> Working out decreases your overall chance of health issues/doctor visits, and aids in weight management.
            <li> Overall, exercising increases your life span! </li>
            </ol>
