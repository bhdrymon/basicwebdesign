        <h1>Screenshots of Different Types of Training</h1>
        <p>What are all the different types of physical training? Sometimes they're hard to keep up with. For beginners,
            yoga is typically the way to go. Yoga helps loosen up your muscles, it increases balance and stability, and
            a lot of times acts as a form of meditation. (First picture.)</p>
            
        <p>Then, one can hop into cardio-literally. Cardio is typically a more 
            fast-pace workout, and can get extremely intense depending on your level of comfortability. It's a great trasnition
            from yoga to the more "intense" forms of exercise. Cardio can be anything from running a lap around a track, to 
            swimming in a pool. Cardio typically works out every part of the body. (Second picture.)</p>

        <p>Last, you have crossfit. Crossfit is very intense, and is typically practiced to build strentgh and agility.
            Some say crossfit is also the best way to lose weight. (Third picture.)</p>
