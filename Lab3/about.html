        <h2>About Random Dogs</h2>
        <p>Do you love dogs? Of course you do, everyone loves dogs! And if you don't, then I don't trust you. Sorry. We love
            dogs for many obvious reasons such as they're cute, furry, and cuddly. Maybe even your best friend, they do make good 
            listeners and never give bad advice.</p>

        <p>Did you know dogs see in color? Unlike humans who have three cones in their eyes, dogs only have two. Giving them
            the ability to only distinguish colors on a blue and yellow scale. On the other hand, they have better night vision 
            than humans, and can take information 25% faster than us. Pretty cool right?</p>
